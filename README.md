Get current location of a user?
Yes, there is JavaScript functionality in a browser to get the current location of the user. This functionality is provided through the Geolocation API, which allows you to retrieve the geographical position (latitude and longitude) of the user's device. To use this feature, you would typically use the
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()
method. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

if ("geolocation" in navigator) {
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
console.log("Latitude is :", position.coords.latitude);
console.log("Longitude is :", position.coords.longitude);
});
} else {
console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
}
This code checks if the Geolocation API is supported in the browser. If it is, it retrieves the current position of the device and logs the latitude and longitude to the console. Note that using the Geolocation API requires the user's permission to share their location.
